# The rust programming language 
### my opinion is this language will replace any thing that is writen in c++
### for game development , operating system , compilers  and any performance 
### critical application rust will be the best language out there 

## Why i'm learning rust 
### as a c , cpp developer i want an easy way to memory management 
### the famous problem . i forget to free (delete) my memory after use it
### also array out of bound indexing  (c lang let you go to infinity in memory no limit)
### i tired from making my programm crashing so i need compiler checking
### in other words the borrow checker 

### another good reason for learning rust is that by reach the intermediate to 
### advance level i will be over all a better programmer and better Software engineer
### by knowing the best practices for memory manage and develop things with the 
### performance on mind and with the stack vs heap allocation and low level staff 
### knowing how every thing realy works under the hood and communicate with the memory


## What is my strategy to Learn 

### Finish the `Rust programmming language Book`
[link for lets Get rusty youtuber who will finish the book with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX9HJsJUDxA&list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8)

<hr/>

### after that you will need to build something like cli tools or implement 
### a web server and simple backend staff if you are interested or cli game 

## my recommendation project
### Create a program that looks inside a folder for files, opens them, 
### and checks each line for a specific word. If the word is found, 
### the program should store the entire line on a data structure and after finish
### the search should print them on reverse order.


### Finish the ` Rust for rustaceans Book`
[Jon Gjengset the author of this book also made course on youtube ](https://youtu.be/rAl-9HwD858?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa)

<hr/>

### after that you will need to build complex project 
### build a full backend web api that is communicate with mysql DataBase 
### to serve a to do app or blog site for example you can for the server use web framework like
### rocket or actix-web 



### i will update this road map as i,m going so if you are interested on the 
### previous versions on this road map i will tag them as 0.0.0 the oldest road map
### 0.0.1 edit sentence or something not realy usefull 0.1.0 add thing to the road 
### map or 1.0.0 change alot of things
